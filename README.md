He has developed a calculator.This engine has provided the development of the computer.Charles babbage’s time mathematical tables contained many errors.He has seen the error of these tables and  he began to design calculators..Charles Babbage invented the  difference engine the year 1830.Ada Byron who is British mathematician and she has been supporting his work.Babbage’s machine program has Byron.But  Ada Byron died at a young age so the work remained incomplete.Ada Byron’s first female programmers and Charles Babbage is known as the first computer designers</p></p></p>

<p><p style="font-family:calibri"><p style="font-size:30px">This is designed for calculating the polynominal.Blaise Pascal was the first to design such a engine.Then in 1694 by Gottfired Wilhem von Leibniz later devoloped this machine and add the division with multiplication.After a long hiatus in 1822,Charles Babbage designed the engine difference.Differences engine was design to be able to automatically calculate the series of values.This caculation was possible by taking   advantage of the finite difference method.Difference engine,the project’s first form,at 2.5 m height,will be made up of 15 tonnes and 25.000 part.It is now the london science museum.The printer section was completed in 1998 with donations from Microsoft.</p>
